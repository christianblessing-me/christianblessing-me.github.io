<blockquote>
<p>A system that told you exactly where to put every piece of information in your life – every document, file, note, agenda, outline, and bit of research – and exactly where to find it when you needed it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aggressively popularized &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much-needed second thought.

In the early 1990s, Jay Chiat of the Chiat-Day advertising agency brought on star architects such as Gaetano Pesce and Frank Gehry to provide him with radical, fashionable office spaces over which the actual workers had no control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traffic noise has been flagged as a major physiological stressor, second to air pollution and on roughly equal footing with exposure to secondhand smoke and radon.</p>
