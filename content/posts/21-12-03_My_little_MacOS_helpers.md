We all love and use them everyday, those (little) helpers that help us on a daily basis to fulfil our goals when working with our system(s). Here's my list of tools that make my life easier with macOS and the web (I've already published this on [Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-little-macos-helpers-christian-blessing/)).
